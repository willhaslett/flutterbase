# FlutterBase Purpose

This project is designed to serve as a personal plug-in manager and collection of pluggable features for Flutter applications. As an experienced software engineer going into business for myself, I aim to use this tool to streamline the development of new Flutter projects by providing a menu of modular, pluggable features that can be easily integrated into any new Flutter application.

The core concept is to create a flexible, extensible system where I can:
1. Maintain a curated collection of Flutter features and components
2. Quickly add these features to new projects through a simple interface
3. Customize and configure features based on project requirements
4. Build a consistent, high-quality foundation for all my Flutter applications

This tool will help standardize my development process while maintaining the flexibility to adapt features to specific project needs. The current template provides the basic infrastructure for this system, which will be expanded with specific pluggable features in the future.
